        When I say sit my dog lies down; <br />
        Rollover makes her bark;<br />
        I order her to fetch the ball,<br />
        But she just roams the park.<br />

        When I say shake she lifts her ears<br />
        And sits up straight and tall,<br />
        So proud that she knows what to do<br />
        (She’s no idea at all).
