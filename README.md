# CIS235-TeamProjectWebsite
We created a fun gallery and cool features of dog images. The primary feature is that if you hover over a specific place on the page, the dogs transform into evil mode. The second fun feature is when you click on an image, the dog's eyes become evil for 60ms and then go back to normal. We also have a cute poem for dog lovers or whoever visits our page. You will have to click on a button to see the poem. You will also see an alert message when the poem is successfully loaded. Try it yourself, and we hope you will enjoy it!
